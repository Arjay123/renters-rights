            <h3> When can a tenant be evicted? Can a tenant be evicted for no cause? </h3>
            <p>On May 9, 2017, the City Council adopted the <strong>Tenant Protection Ordinance</strong>.  Additionally, the City Council adopted an Urgency Ordinance making the new regulations effective immediately. The Tenant Protection Ordinance outlines landlord responsibilities and tenant rights regarding notices to terminate.  Under the Tenant Protection Ordinance, landlords of multifamily dwellings, guesthouses and unpermitted units will only be authorized to terminate tenancy under one of the 12 listed <strong>just causes </strong> (view flyer in <a href="http://www.sanjoseca.gov/DocumentCenter/View/69126">English</a>, <a href="http://www.sanjoseca.gov/DocumentCenter/View/69112">Spanish</a> and <a href="http://www.sanjoseca.gov/DocumentCenter/View/69113">Vietnamese</a>). </p>

            <h3>What is the Apartment Rental Dispute Mediation and Arbitration Ordinance (ARO)?</h3>
            <p>The City of San José’s <a href="http://www.sanjoseca.gov/index.aspx?nid=1355">Apartment Rental Dispute Mediation and Arbitration Ordinance (ARO)</a> regulates the annual amount that rents can increase in apartments in San José with three or more units that were first rented before September 7, 1979. </p>

            <p>Properties that are covered by San José's Apartment Rent Ordinance include apartments with three or more units that were built and occupied prior to September 7, 1979. </p>

            <h4> How much can my rent be raised?</h4>
            <p><strong>Allowable Rent Increase Under the Ordinance</strong></p>
            <p>Under the Apartment Rent Ordinance, rent increases may only be given once in a 12-month period. The maximum annual allowable increase is 5%.</p>
            <p>The City Council has directed that changes be made to the Apartment Rent Ordinance. Staff anticipates that revisions to the Ordinance will be completed by the end of 2017.</p>
            <p>Beginning June 17, 2016, an <a href="http://www.sanjoseca.gov/DocumentCenter/View/61857">Interim Ordinance</a> will be in effect until revisions to the Apartment Rent Ordinance are completed. The Interim Ordinance reduces the annual allowable rent increase from 8% to 5% and outlines the process for filing cost pass-through petitions.</p>

            <p><strong>Exceptions to the Allowable Rent Increases</strong></p>
            <p>Rent increases that are exempt from these requirements include an increase after the rental unit has been voluntarily vacated by the tenant, and an increase after eviction of a tenant.</p> 
            <p>Under the Apartment Rent Ordinance, both property owners and tenants may file a petition. Property owners who file a petition to increase rent in excess 5% must submit a cost worksheet to the Rental Rights and Referrals Program. Pending a decision by the Hearing Officer, the amount of rent in excess of 5% is deferred and only an 5% rent increase should be demanded or paid.</p>
            <p>Landlords may file a <strong>Fair Return petition</strong> if they would like to request the ability to iincrease rent more than 5% because of substantial capital improvements or capital expenses, unusually low rents, uninsured damage or vandalism, or other reasons.</p>
            <p>Tenants with a rent increase subject to review and/or service reduction claims or housing code violations may file a petition. </p>

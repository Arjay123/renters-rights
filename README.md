# Renter's Friend
Renter's Friend is a Code for San Jose project to provide a web application that informs renters of their rights, beginning with residents in San Jose.

## Why
After conducting user research, renters expressed common issues - dealing with eviction or rising rent. It can be difficult to navigate policy jargon to understand renters rights and procedures to address issues with landlords.

## Tech
The web application will be built in Rails, React.js, React-on-Rails gem, and PostgreSQL.

## How to Run This

| Dependency      | Version       | 
| --------------: |--------------:| 
| Ruby            | 2.3.3p222     |
| Rails           | 5.0.4         |
| PostgreSQL      | 9.6.3         | 
| react_on_rails  | 8.0.3         |

After you install the dependencies, to start the frontend:

1. Git clone this repo
2. ```bundle install```
3. ```bundle exec rails db:setup```
4. ```bundle exec rails s```
5. Navigate to ```localhost:3000``` to see the index
